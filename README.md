# RubiksCubeAI
With a simple AI that can solve a Rubik's Cube, my partner and I created a Java application that allows a user to input the configuration of their Rubik's Cube and receive step-by-step instructions on how to solve it using an interactive 3D rendition of their cube on the screen.

Code for this project is coming soon. We did not origionally complete the project on GitHub, so I am currently working on gathering the necessary files to upload.
