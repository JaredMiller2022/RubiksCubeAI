# RubiksCubeAI
Junior year of high school, for my AP Computer Science final project, my partner and I created a Processing application that allows a user to input the configuration of their Rubik's Cube and receive step-by-step instructions on how to solve it using an interactive 3D rendition of their cube on the screen.

Processing is a Java based OOP platform created by MIT graduates. Go to https://processing.org/ for more information or to download the platform.
